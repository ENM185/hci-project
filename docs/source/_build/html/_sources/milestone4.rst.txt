:User Story 1.1: **As a professor, I want to be able answer a series of anonymous questions from my students, so that I may interact with them without putting them in the spotlight.** We addressed this by including this series of questions in the usual chat, in order to provide the instructor with a simple, known way of finding and answering these questions. The auto animations simulate interaction between the student and instructor.

:User Story 2.1: **As a professor, I want to see a queue of questions so that I can make it easier for students virtual and physical to solicit input on class subjects without talking over each other or asking repetitive questions that may arise from inability to properly converse between in-person and virtual-students.** We addressed this with a new button at the bottom of the screen called "queue" that allows the instructor to open up a queue. When students are in the queue, the instructor can see who is in the queue, go through the queue, and easily see the student at the front. Their video shows in the same way it would in the main panel so the instructor can see whom they're interacting with.

:User Story 2.2: ****

:User Story 3.1: **As a professor, I want to have a dedicated panel (a sort of "landing page" component) for these new options so I can easily enable/disable them and adjust their settings from one place.** We actually went off of the original user story, and integrated the settings into the features themselves, as not to make the new settings seem out of place. In the chat, within the already-existing options menu, the instructor can enable/disable automatic questions. This makes it simple for the instructor to find the setting (as it's where the instructor would expect it if they were already familiar with previous Zoom versions). Similarly, we included the mute options within the queue, rather than in a separate panel. This allows the instructor to easily control the settings immediately when needed, without opening up separate menus.

Research Question and Methodology
**********************************

**Research Question**: How can we encourage participation from both online and remote students in a way that also prevents too many intervening at the same time that impedes effective discussion?

**Methodology**: Our methodology will be a mix of Observations and Experiments


Testing Procedure
************************************

1. Observations
-----------------------

We begin by viewing a series of hybrid-synchronous learning classes. We are looking for information about how often students interact with the professor and each-other. This will also be our Control Group for the sake of experimentation. This includes data such as: 

    1. How many students are remote vs. in person
    2. How frequently are questions asked
    3. Which students are asking the questions (remote vs. In-Person)
    4. How long do they have their hand raised or wait on average for their question to be answered
    5. How does the timing compare between questions asked in chat or by signaling the “hand raised” emoji in Zoom and which is faster?
    6. How does this vary by professor, class size, or type of question?
    7. Are these questions being asked primarily over voice or by chat?


2. Data Analysis
-----------------

By collecting this information we can begin to create models of what our average hybrid-synchronous class looks like at UGA and the habits of students. 

    For example, if we find that students preferred to ask questions over voice instead of text, our priority would shift to improving the question-answering queue system. However, if we found that they preferred to have inquiries submitted by text, then our focus would move slightly to the anonymous question queue to better meet the trends of the students involved.



3. Informed Consent
--------------------

To acquire informed consent we would verify with the professor that they were ok with us recording and viewing their class, sometimes in person and sometimes-remote. We would also collect consent waivers for all participants in the experiment.


4. Pandemic Safety
-------------------

Since a lot of this will be conducted on Zoom, we will do mostly monitoring of Zoom classes. However, with the permission of the professor and space permitting, we would like to visit a few classes in-person to create a more well-rounded model of student behavior. 

* If visiting in person we will comply with all relevant safety procedures in conjunction with University Guidelines

5. Experimentation
-------------------

Ideally we would like to conduct two blind tests. One where we have participants act as the professor and one as the student. 
    1. **Student** - We would like them to ask a question to a fake zoom class while using one of the interfaces we create and decide for themselves which one fits the appropriate subject matter and context. These contexts could vary based on the location of the student (remote vs. in-person), the timeliness of the question, the subject matter, etc. This will better help us understand both the habits of the students, the easiness of the system’s use, and which area still needs work.
    2. **Professor** - We would like to have either students roleplay as a professor or ask actual ones to test the system. We can do this by presenting the professor with a variety of questions asked in various ways offered by the new system. For example we would like to see their approach tackling the question-queue, if they prioritize live questions or text-based, and how long they take to do so. Understanding the timing and the ways professors interact with eager students is paramount to an understanding of how to best increase participation from those same students.
