The Problem
************

**Initial Problem**: With some students attending in person and some attending remotely, it can be difficult to encourage participation online when answering or asking questions from the remote students.

:Instructors: On the instructor side, this is a problem because it becomes hard to engage with a class that has low participation. For example, there are often times where instructors ask questions, and no one on Zoom answers (whereas it would be easier to converse naturally face-to-face). This makes it hard for instructors to gauge how well the students are learning.

:Students: On the students' end, especially those who attend remotely, this is an issue because students working from a home environment tend to feel less connected to the lecture than those in the classroom and feel less inclined to participate remotely. Also, in the classroom, asking a question provides some anonymity (especially in a lecture hall), but remote formats (like Zoom) will highlight the student's name, which can be a problem if they have anxiety. 


A Typical Interaction: 
	The instructor plans out a lesson that involves the ability of the students in the crowd to solicit feedback, instructions, and answers to various questions. The success of the lesson often involves this feedback from the audience. The instructor asks a question but as most of the class may be remote, they find it difficult to encourage participation and stare into an empty screen. This could be for a variety of reasons including that the student is not paying attention, it is difficult to respond one-at-a-time, or that the student may be embarrassed to answer in a zoom that is more visible. Sometimes feedback may come from a remote student which is difficult for an in-person student to properly hear or respond to and vice-versa due to microphone issues. When this occurs the instructor is not able to effectively convey their information to both types of students and as a result the lesson does not go as successfully as they had intended because the necessary information was not given to the audience.


Users: 
	Instructors are primarily affected by this problem. They struggle to get participation from the remote users, which causes issues when attempting to establish an ongoing discussion or receive feedback from students to know what they can improve or clarify. 

	Remote users are also affected by this problem because they are missing out on learning opportunities and will not retain the information being presented. In-person students are somewhat affected because they do not get as much involvement from their peers, but they still receive the benefit of being directly present in class.

Existing Solutions
******************

1. Tophat:
	It existed before remote learning was popular, but the program quickly found its place in the hybrid synchronous environment. Top Hat allows instructors to present topic-relevant questions to their students to measure how well the class is understanding the material. The only downside to this solution is the time-sensitivity of questions. Some students may be penalized for missing a question even if it was due to some delay through the remote lecture.

2. Zoom Breakout Rooms: 
	The breakout rooms encourage students to work together and engage in the class discussion. By breaking students into small groups and assigning a task for the group to complete, students are very compelled to participate because it will be obvious that they are not participating. They would not want to let down their group and their lack of cooperation will most likely be reported to the instructor. The only downside to this solution is that a student could suffer if the rest of their group does not participate.

3. Zoom Quiz Questions:
	The instructor can send out a question to the viewers to respond to. Could be used as an attendance system if the question is simple but it's very rudimentary and doesnâ€™t connect to any outside sources of information.

Proposed Solutions
******************

1. Tiered Point System
	A tiered, points system for participation to keep students engaged during class. The program would give students many options to contribute to the class and reward the students who do all or some of the options. The goal of the program is to incentivize in-class participation through a variety of human-computer solutions that block distractions, keep students involved and encourage challenges. The points can be treated similarly to earned sky miles, where 100 points = 1 extra point on an exam or can be used to drop a quiz.

	| Action                          | Points     |
	+=================================+============+
	| Lockdown Phone                  | 10         |
	+---------------------------------+------------+
	| Lockdown Browser                | 10         |
	+---------------------------------+------------+
	| Camera on/in focus              | 8          |
	+---------------------------------+------------+
	| Tracking Zoom Window Focus      | 5          |
	+---------------------------------+------------+
	| "Verify Attention Button" [1]_  | 3          |
	+---------------------------------+------------+

2. Anonymous Input Solicitation
	Create a place where students can submit questions anonymously due to Zoom highlighting their name. This would allow more students who do not want to be in the spotlight to feel more comfortable asking questions over hybrid-asynchronous remote learning.  

	This can be turned into a challenge: ask at least 2 good questions to receive 2 pts 

3. Question Queueing System
	A system for asking question without having others talking over each-other. When you want to ask a question you put your name in the Queue which works like a regular data structure and then it tells you your place in line to ask the question or provide feedback to the instructor.
